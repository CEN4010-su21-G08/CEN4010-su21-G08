    <h1>Christian Engman's Page</h1>      
    <p> Hi! My name is Christian Engman. 
        I am 16 years old, and am currently a Junior at FAU
        and a dual enrolled FAU High School student. 
        I am a dual major in Computer Science and Mathematics, 
        and am interested into going into cryptography.
        I am taking this class for my Computer Science major requirements.</p>

    <h3>About the Page:</h3>
    <p>I took most of the elements of this page from my assignment in COP 3813 
      Internet Computing. I already had an about me page ready from this class,
       and I thought it fit the requirements very well. Some elements have been updated, 
       as this page was orignally written a few months ago.</p>

        <h2>Programming</h2>
        <p>
            I have been programming for about 6 or 7 years now. I started in 
            Python, learning basic concepts like lists, loops, types, ect. I 
            also have a lot of experience with functional programming, specifically 
            in the Haskell language, in which much of my programming background is in.
            After coming to FAU, I began learning C and C++, applying my prior skills
            in other areas.

        <h2>Computers</h2>
        <p>
            I have been working with computers and computer hardware for most of my
            life. When I got my first laptop, I figured out how to open the bottom
            and poked around inside of it. Eventually, I learned how to replace RAM
            and storage, and about a year and a half ago, I built my first Desktop computer.
